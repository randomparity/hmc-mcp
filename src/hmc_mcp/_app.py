"""Shared app state and entry points for the hmc-mcp server.

Builds empty :class:`FastMCP` instances for explicit composition and provides
the small sync-run / SSH-passthrough helpers used by tool bodies. Tool
capability classification lives on each tool's ``ToolSecurity`` record in
``tool_registry.py``; see docs/adr/0035-enforceable-tool-security-metadata.md.

``server.py`` imports this module and every ``server_*`` domain module; the
domain modules import ``mcp`` back from here (one-way dependency, no
cycles). The client-visible instructions live here too, and ``server.py``
qualifies them against its access policy before composing
(docs/adr/0048-ceiling-aware-server-instructions.md).

    "Tools for querying and operating IBM Power systems via the HMC "
    "(Hardware Management Console) REST API. Managed systems are Power "
    "servers; logical partitions (LPARs) are the AIX/Linux/IBM i virtual "
    "servers running on them. Most read tools return parsed uom Atom "
    "entries as JSON.\n\n"
    "## Composite tools — prefer these for common tasks\n\n"
    "These tools aggregate multiple HMC endpoints in a single call and "
    "should be the first choice when their scope matches the task:\n\n"
    "- **hmc_lpar_summary(lpar_name_or_uuid)** — state, RMC status, "
    "memory/CPU, OS version, and adapter count for one LPAR. Use instead "
    "of hmc_list_lpars + hmc_list_adapters when you need a quick health check "
    "or status snapshot of a single partition.\n"
    "- **hmc_system_summary(system_name_or_uuid)** — system state, total "
    "resources, LPAR count and state breakdown, and VIOS state for one "
    "managed system. Use instead of hmc_list_systems + hmc_list_lpars + hmc_list_vios "
    "when you need an overview of a single server.\n"
    "- **hmc_capacity_report()** — total, assigned, and free memory (MiB) "
    "and processor units for every managed system, plus running/total LPAR "
    "counts. Use to survey available capacity across the whole HMC.\n"
    "- **hmc_fleet_health()** — exception-only estate view covering systems "
    "not operating, VIOS not running, inactive LPAR RMC, and recent failed "
    "jobs. Use for a bounded fleet health check instead of composing raw lists.\n"
    "- **hmc_find_placement(desired_memory_mb, desired_proc_units)** — "
    "returns systems that can host a new LPAR of the given size, sorted by "
    "free memory. Use before provisioning to choose a target system.\n"
    "- **hmc_list_recent_jobs(limit)** — most-recent HMC async jobs (power ops, "
    "firmware, migrations) on HMC versions that expose the global Job feed. "
    "Use to audit recent activity; poll a submitted job through its SELF link.\n"
    "- **hmc_provision_lpar(...)** — end-to-end LPAR creation: creates the "
    "partition, attaches a virtual network adapter, and optionally attaches "
    "a vSCSI disk. Supports dry_run=True to validate inputs without making "
    "changes. For lower-level creation without adapters, use hmc_create_lpar.\n\n"
    "## Resource addressing and asynchronous jobs\n\n"
    "Parameters ending in `*_name_or_uuid` accept either a resource name or UUID. "
    "Parameters\nending in `*_uuid` require a UUID. SSH-passthrough tools usually resolve "
    "UUIDs to HMC CLI\nnames before running the command. VIOS backup catalog tools are "
    "exceptions:\n`hmc_list_vios_backups` passes a VIOS UUID directly. `hmc_backup_vios` "
    "and\n`hmc_restore_vios` are SSH-ready with a direct system name plus VIOS UUID; a "
    "VIOS name or\nsystem UUID requires REST. A system UUID resolves to its unique MTMS "
    "identity, never an HMC\nCLI name, with no `lssyscfg` fallback.\n\n"
    "For tools that expose asynchronous wait controls, `wait=False` is the default "
    "and returns\nthe submitted job for later polling; `wait=True` polls until the "
    "job reaches a terminal\nstate. Install tools use `wait_timeout_seconds=None` "
    "by default, deriving the client-side\npolling budget from "
    "`hmc_timeout_minutes` plus one poll interval. Other wait-capable tools\nuse "
    "`timeout_seconds=300` by default. `poll_interval=5` is the default number of "
    "seconds\nbetween status requests.\n\n"
    "## Recommended workflows\n\n"
    "**Check LPAR status:** hmc_lpar_summary → inspect state/rmc_state/os_version.\n\n"
    "**Survey a server:** hmc_system_summary → inspect system state, LPAR "
    "counts, and VIOS health in one call.\n\n"
    "**Plan new LPAR placement:** hmc_capacity_report (see all systems) → "
    "hmc_find_placement(mem, cpu) (filter to candidates) → pick system_uuid.\n\n"
    "**Provision a new LPAR:** hmc_find_placement → hmc_provision_lpar with "
    "dry_run=True (validate) → hmc_provision_lpar with dry_run=False (execute) "
    "→ hmc_lpar_summary (confirm).\n\n"
    "**Track an operation:** retain the job UUID and SELF link returned by the "
    "submitting tool → hmc_get_job(job_uuid, job_href=self_link) for detail → "
    "hmc_wait_for_job(job_uuid, job_href=self_link) to poll until done. Use "
    "hmc_list_recent_jobs only for HMC versions that support the global feed.\n\n"
    "**Migrate safely:** hmc_migrate_lpar validates to a successful terminal "
    "state before migration by default; set validate_first=False only to "
    "request direct submission explicitly.\n\n"
    "**Diagnose a failed install:** hmc_capture_lpar_console returns a bounded,\n"
    "write-sealed snapshot of the partition console (SMS menu, firmware prompt,\n"
    "BOS installer error). It holds the partition's single vterm slot while it\n"
    "runs and fails with a distinct contention error when an operator already\n"
    "holds the console; it never sends input to the partition.\n\n"
    "## Lower-level tools\n\n"
    "Use the individual tools (hmc_list_systems, hmc_list_lpars, hmc_list_vios, "
    "hmc_list_adapters, etc.) when you need raw resource data, fields not "
    "returned by the composite tools, or operations outside the composite "
    "tool scope (network, storage, templates, metrics, users).\n\n"
    "## Multi-agent ownership protocol\n\n"
    "When multiple agents share this server, LPAR ownership is tracked via "
    "a description-field token: ``[hmc-mcp owner:<agent_id> created:<date>]``.\n\n"
    "**On create:** Ownership tokens are stamped automatically by "
    "hmc_create_lpar and hmc_provision_lpar. A completed "
    "hmc_deploy_partition_template call also stamps automatically when wait=True "
    "and its before/after LPAR snapshots identify exactly one new partition. If "
    "ownership_stamped is None, follow the returned warning: resolve the LPAR name "
    "(e.g. via hmc_list_lpars or hmc_lpar_summary) and call "
    "hmc_set_lpar_description to write the ownership token.\n\n"
    "**Before delete / rename / description-overwrite:** Read the LPAR "
    "description with hmc_get_lpar_description or hmc_lpar_summary. If it "
    "contains ``[hmc-mcp owner:<id> ...]`` and <id> differs from your "
    "HMC_AGENT_ID, stop and ask the operator before proceeding.\n\n"
    "**Absent token:** An LPAR with no token was created before this feature "
    "or through a path that does not stamp. Treat it as unowned and proceed "
    "with caution — ask the operator if in doubt.\n\n"
    "**Set HMC_AGENT_ID** in the environment for per-agent attribution in "
    "HMC audit logs (X-Audit-Memento: hmc-mcp:<agent_id>)."
