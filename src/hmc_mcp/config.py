"""Configuration for hmc-mcp.

Settings are resolved in priority order:
  1. CLI options / explicit constructor args
  2. Environment variables (HMC_*)
  3. TOML profile (~/.config/hmc-mcp/config.toml or platform equivalent)

Checkout-local .env files are NOT loaded: HMCConfig declares no ``env_file``, so
no dotenv source is configured. Passing ``_env_file=None`` is therefore inert
here, and it never suppressed environment variables in any case.

Use load_profile() to load a named profile from the platform-native config file.
Use HMCConfig(...) directly for explicit construction that should still honour
HMC_* — the CLI and MCP server paths.
Use HMCConfig.from_mapping(...) when a value must come from the mapping or the
field default and never from the ambient environment (ADR 0096); a library
consumer building one config per HMC wants this one.

        """Build a config from *values* alone, reading no environment and no dotenv.

        The ordinary constructor resolves every field left unset from the ambient
        ``HMC_*`` environment. That is what an operator running the CLI or the MCP
        server wants. It is not what a process building one config per HMC from
        database rows wants: a stray ``HMC_HOST`` in the deployment environment
        points a backend at a different HMC than its row names, a stray
        ``HMC_SSH_KEY_FILE`` offers the wrong private key, and a stray
        ``HMC_AGENT_ID`` corrupts ownership attribution on every LPAR the process
        stamps — none of which raises.

        Here, a key in *values* naming a field is applied and every field *values*
        omits takes its declared field default. Nothing else can supply a value:
        every field is passed as an explicit constructor argument, and constructor
        arguments are pydantic-settings' highest-priority source. Note that
        ``_env_file=None`` would *not* achieve this — it suppresses a dotenv
        source and never touches the environment (see
        ``docs/environment-variables.md``).

        Validation is unchanged: field validators and the model validator run
        exactly as they do for ``HMCConfig(...)``. Keys naming no field are
        ignored, matching the ``extra="ignore"`` in ``model_config``. A key whose
        value is ``None`` is applied like any other — a nullable database column
        arriving as ``None`` is a validation error for every field but
        ``ssh_key_file`` and ``agent_id``, so omit the key rather than passing
        ``None`` when the intent is "use the default".

        ``model_fields_set`` reports the keys *values* supplied, not the full
        field set, so ``model_dump(exclude_unset=True)`` round-trips and the
        ``verify_ssl`` provenance in the TLS audit record stays accurate.

        A field whose default comes from a factory that takes ``validated_data``
        is not supported here and raises pydantic's own error; ``HMCConfig``
        declares no such field, and a subclass that does should not inherit this
        method.

        Raises:
            ValueError: When *values* omits a field that has no default. The
                omission does not leak — the field is still passed explicitly,
                so the environment is still shut out — but pydantic would report
                it as a type error about ``PydanticUndefined``. This names the

        The record is bounded and evicts in insertion order — see

    ``HMCConfig`` leaves pydantic-settings' ``case_sensitive`` at its ``False``
    default, so ``hmc_host=...`` populates ``host`` exactly as ``HMC_HOST=...``
    does. Every hand-rolled read of an ``HMC_*`` variable that predicts, mirrors,
    or reports on that resolution has to match the same way, or it disagrees with
    the loader it is describing — which is how a profile's TOML key came to beat a
    lower-case export (#531).

    Returns ``None`` only when no casing of *name* is set. When several casings
    are set, the **last** one in ``os.environ`` order wins — the exact spelling
    gets no precedence. That is not a tie-break chosen here: pydantic-settings'
    ``parse_env_vars`` folds the whole environment into ``{key.lower(): value}``
    in ``os.environ`` order, so the last match is the one that reaches the field.
    Preferring the exact spelling instead would leave ``HMC_HOST=""`` beside a
    non-empty ``hmc_host`` reading as an unset host to the ADR 0038 gates below
    while the config resolved to the exported one — the fail-open this function
    exists to close.

    The fold is ``str.lower()`` for the same reason, and not because it reads
    the same as ``str.upper()``: over Unicode the two are different relations,
    and ``_get_env_var_key`` folds down. Folding up would both match names the
    loader ignores and miss names it reads — ``hmc_ho\u017ft`` upper-folds to
    ``HMC_HOST`` while the loader never sees it, and ``hmc_ssh_\u212aey_file``
    reaches ``ssh_key_file`` while an upper-fold never matches it.

    ``tests/unit/test_config.py`` pins the agreement against ``HMCConfig``
    itself rather than against that reading of the library, so a change to
    pydantic-settings' folding shows up as a failing test.

    The keys are snapshotted and each read with a default, never iterated as
    items: ``os.environ.items()`` comes from the ``Mapping`` mixin and re-indexes
    every key after ``__iter__`` has already snapshotted them, so a key an
    embedding host deletes from another thread in between raises ``KeyError``
    out of here. Two of the callers are on the ADR 0038 dispatch-time
    authorization path, where that would escape as a bare ``KeyError`` past the
    denial machinery; the atomic ``os.environ.get`` calls this function replaced
    could not raise, and neither may it.
