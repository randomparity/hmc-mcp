    lpar_name_or_uuid: accepts either a PartitionName or a UUID

    By default, submits validation, waits for successful terminal validation,
    then submits migration. Validation failure, exception, or timeout raises
    without submitting migration. Set validate_first=False for direct submission.

    Set wait=True to block until the job reaches COMPLETED / FAILED / EXCEPTION
    (or until timeout_seconds elapses). The returned ``JobOutcome`` describes
    this submission: ``found`` is false when the submission returned no job
    entry, and ``job_href`` is the HMC submission link when one was returned.
    ``job_id`` may be a synthetic, non-pollable label, so poll only an HMC
    handle returned in the outcome.

    Args:
        lpar_name_or_uuid: Source partition name or UUID.
        target_system_name_or_uuid: Destination managed-system name or UUID.

        wait: Wait for the migration job's terminal outcome when true.
        timeout_seconds: Maximum client-side wait in seconds.
        poll_interval: Seconds between job-status requests while waiting.
        validate_first: Validate successfully before submitting migration when true.
        ownership_override: Bypass LPAR ownership rejection after operator approval.
        profile: Optional TOML profile name; uses environment defaults when omitted.
        system_name_or_uuid: Optional SystemName or UUID of the source system,
