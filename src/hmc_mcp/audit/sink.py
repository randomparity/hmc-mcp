    Three producers share it, and the third is what ADR 0051 added: this module's
    audit records, ``server._warn``'s startup prose, and — once
    ``server.install_third_party_stderr_sinks`` has run — the records of the bound
    third-party loggers (``fastmcp``, ``uvicorn``, ``uvicorn.access``, ``mcp``),
    tracebacks included. One bound, one drop counter, and one writer covering all
    three is the point rather than an accident; a second mechanism on this
    descriptor would be a second failure mode on it.

    A synchronous ``write()`` to a pipe nobody is draining blocks. It raises
    nothing, so no guard fires, and under ADR 0040 that write sits inside
    ``dispatch_scope.authorize`` — ahead of the denial and ahead of the handler — so
    the server stops answering. One bounded queue and one daemon writer move the
    only blocking call in the chain onto a thread whose progress nothing waits on.

    A full queue **drops** the line and counts it, which is the trade
    ADR 0043 takes deliberately: a droppable audit trail that keeps serving, over a
    complete one that stops. Nothing is lost silently — the count is written into
    the stream as a ``records-dropped`` record ahead of the next line that lands.

    ``sys.stderr`` is resolved per write rather than bound at construction, an
    absent stream is skipped, and ``OSError`` and ``ValueError`` are caught: the
    same three guards ADR 0040 gave the handler, for the same three reasons —
    CPython sets ``sys.stderr`` to ``None`` when fd 2 is closed at interpreter
    start, a broken stream raises ``OSError``, and a closed one raises
    ``ValueError``. What changes is that each of them now counts a drop.

    Each item is written with its newline in **one** call. ``logging``'s lock
    serialises audit records against each other but against nothing else on this
    stream — the interpreter's own exit traceback and any handler an operator
    attached elsewhere still write to it directly — so a second call could let
    another writer land between a record and its terminator. Since ADR 0051 that
    one call is also what makes a FastMCP traceback atomic: it is one item, so it
    cannot be interleaved and cannot be half-dropped.
