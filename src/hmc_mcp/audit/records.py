"""The authorization audit record: its vocabulary and rendering.

One record per authorization decision, emitted from ``dispatch_scope.authorize`` —
the only place in the package that reaches one. See
docs/adr/0040-authorization-audit-events.md.

This module imports only the sink's :func:`emit` function from ``hmc_mcp``.
``target_scope`` imports :data:`Reason` and :data:`State` from here, so every
other value arrives as a primitive. The single exception is
:data:`ATTRIBUTION_ENV`, read from
``os.environ`` here rather than passed in: no module on the decision path may name
that variable (which is what makes "attribution cannot change an outcome" an
invariant rather than a sample), and reading it through ``HMCConfig`` would apply
validators that reject exactly the malformed values worth recording.

The record's grammar is one physical line of ASCII JSON. ``ensure_ascii=True`` is the
control, not a default worth keeping: JSON encoding already escapes newlines and C0
control characters, and this is what additionally stops a bidirectional override or
U+2028 in an LPAR name passing through raw to a line-oriented reader.

Stability, so a later change knows what it may not do: a field may be added, never
renamed, removed, or retyped; a reason code may be added, never repurposed; a
consumer ignores what it does not know. There is no version field — a written rule
settles it, and a second mechanism would have to be kept in agreement with it.
