# Public argument names that carry the identity of an HMC-side resource no
# allowlist can pin down. A tool accepting one cannot declare
# `exhaustive_targets=True`, so a policy `targets` table never grants it and only
# `all-targets` does.
#
# - `file_path` names a file on the HMC's own filesystem, which no TargetKind
#   expresses — ADR 0036 placed it outside every grant.
# - `cmd` is free-form console command text.
# - `vios_partition_id` is a *slot number within one managed system*, reused
#   across every system in a fleet, so an allowlist entry of "2" names a
#   different VIOS on each of them; unlike a partition name it has no UUID form
#   to fall back on, so there is no way to write it precisely.
# - `job_href` is a caller-supplied URI whose *path* replaces the `job_id`
#   selector entirely (`client.get_job`), so the value authorized and the value
#   fetched are different values.
#
# Membership is decided by whether a `targets` table can bound the identity, and
# a name fails that by either of two routes. It cannot be written down at all
# (`cmd` is free-form text; a `vios_partition_id` of "2" names a different VIOS on
# every system), or it can be written and still designates something the declared
# selectors do not contain (`file_path`, `job_href`). Which filesystem the value
# refers to decides nothing: `file_path` is a member because an absolute console
# path is contained by no selector — for `rstprofdata -f`, which only reads it,
# exactly as for `bkprofdata -f` — and not because the file sits on the HMC.
#
# `backup_name` on `hmc_restore_vios` is the HMC-side name that made that
# explicit and is deliberately *not* a member: the selected VIOS backup catalog
# contains the name, so it is reached through containment from a declared
# selector. That holds only while the value cannot leave the catalog, which
# `server_tools.vios._validate_backup_name` is what enforces. ADR 0044 records the
# decision and the two questions it leaves open (#282, #283).
#
# This is not the complement of REQUIRED_TARGET_ARGUMENTS: `vios_partition_id`
# is in both, deliberately. It is a declared selector — so it is extracted and
# compared under `all-targets`, which is what keeps three live tools working —
# *and* an identity no table can bound. The two tables answer different
# questions about the same name and must not be merged.
#
# They are kept adjacent for that reason: together they are one piece of
# knowledge — which public argument names carry which identity — and a name that
# moved between them while they lived in different files would drift silently.
# No runtime path reads this one; the boolean it justifies is what the authorizer
# reads. The ADR 0039 guardrail in tests/app/test_tool_security.py enforces it.
