    *quoted* names list-valued attributes whose HMC-side grammar is a

    rendered as the IBM quoted pair ``"name=v1,v2"``; without a comma it
    renders bare, byte-identical to the unmarked form.  Every other record
    delimiter is refused inside a marked value: only the comma's behaviour
    inside a quoted region is live-verified.

    *pairs* is an ordered sequence of ``(attribute, value)``.  Each value is
    rendered with :func:`str` and checked against the record grammar before the
    record is joined, so no caller-supplied value can introduce or terminate an
    attribute the caller was not given an argument for.

    Callers still wrap the result in :func:`shlex.quote`.  The two mechanisms
    protect different layers and neither substitutes for the other:
    ``shlex.quote`` keeps the record a single word for the *remote shell*; this
    function keeps the record's own ``,``, ``=``, and ``"`` structure meaningful
    for the *HMC's* parser, which runs afterwards on the already-unquoted text.

    The rejection message quotes the offending value back to the caller.  Every
    attribute reaching this function today carries a name, an enumerated mode,
    or a number; do not route a credential attribute (``chhmcusr -i
    "name=…,passwd=…"``) through it without redacting the value first.
