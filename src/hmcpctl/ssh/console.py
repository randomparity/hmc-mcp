"""LPAR console sessions and bounded capture over the HMC ``mkvterm`` CLI.

The HMC exposes exactly one virtual terminal (vterm) per partition through the
``mkvterm``/``rmvterm`` CLI pair over SSH. ``mkvterm`` never exits on its own:
it streams the partition console until torn down, so it structurally cannot
run through :func:`hmcpctl.ssh.transport.run_hmc_command` (a one-shot exec that collects
output until the remote command exits). :class:`ConsoleSession` holds the vterm
on top of :func:`hmcpctl.ssh.transport.open_hmc_connection` with no duration or
byte cap and owns its acquisition and proven release (ADR 0170), including
mid-session suspension for a preempting hold (ADR 0173) and an opt-in
reconnect after a dropped connection (ADR 0174);
:func:`capture_lpar_console` is its bounded consumer and enforces issue #385's
design contract. Every invariant below traces to a recorded observation from
the P1-P8 live-hardware prototype on that issue (HMC V10R3 M1060); ADR 0072
records the design decision per prototype fact.

- **Contention** (P1): a held vterm is reported on *stdout* with exit code 0,
  so the exit status proves nothing; the sentinel sentence below is parsed
  instead and :class:`ConsoleHeldError` is raised, quoting what the HMC printed.
  No ``rmvterm`` is issued on that path — it would release the *other* holder's
  session — unless the caller explicitly asked for a forced takeover (ADR 0172).
- **Mandatory release** (P2/P3/P4): the HMC does not auto-release a vterm,
  not after an abrupt disconnect and not after a graceful close. ``rmvterm``
  therefore runs on every exit path, cancellation included, and runs to
  completion before cancellation propagates. ``released`` is ``True`` only
  after an independent-session ``mkvterm`` probe proves the slot is free;
  ``rmvterm``'s own exit code is not proof (P2). The one exception is a hold
  another client's ``rmvterm`` already ended (#1004): the HMC reports it in
  band, and releasing would end the new holder's session.
- **Sealed stdin** (P5/P7): mkvterm's stdin is the write socket to the
  partition console, and EOF on it terminates the vterm. The capture opens a
  pipe, hands mkvterm the read end, and holds the write end open without ever
  writing: no parameter, method, or code path can send a byte to the console.
  :class:`WritableConsoleSession` is the one exception (ADR 0176): it keeps a
  private stdin writer that never sends EOF, and only its typed, audited write
  methods reach it.
- **Client-side bounds** (P8): an idle vterm stream stays open forever and
  the HMC sends no keepalives, so duration, max-bytes, and idle bounds are all
  enforced here, never expected from the HMC. hmcpctl's own SSH keepalives
  close a connection whose peer is gone (ADR 0174).

The captured bytes are returned raw: truncation backtracks to a boundary that
cannot split a multi-byte UTF-8 sequence or an incomplete ANSI escape
sequence, but decoding remains the caller's decision (issue #385).

    ADR 0170 is the contract. :meth:`open` returns once ``mkvterm`` proves
    this session acquired the vterm and raises :class:`ConsoleHeldError`,
    issuing no ``rmvterm``, when another session holds it (P1). With
    ``take_over=True`` (never the default) :meth:`open` first issues ``rmvterm``
    to end whatever holds the vterm, then acquires as usual (ADR 0172). :meth:`read`
    returns raw chunks, the acquisition bytes first and ``b""`` after the
    remote end closes; the session enforces no bound, so consumers wrap reads
    in their own timeouts. :meth:`close` and :meth:`suspend` are the only
    releases: ``rmvterm``, an independent-session probe, then local teardown,
    run to completion even when the caller is cancelled (P2/P3/P4). Use the
    session as an async context manager so every exit that unwinds the owning
    coroutine closes it.

    A preempting hold pauses collection in one of two modes (ADR 0173):
    :meth:`hand_over` moves the channel to an in-process holder while the vterm
    stays held, and :meth:`suspend`/:meth:`resume` release the vterm for an
    external holder and acquire it again. :meth:`read` waits while paused.

    With ``reconnect=True`` (never the default; the bounded capture never sets
    it), a dropped connection seen by the collector's read starts one
    re-acquisition, and :meth:`read` then yields a :class:`ConsoleGap` before
    the new stream (ADR 0174). A vterm still held after the drop raises
    :class:`ConsoleHeldAfterDropError` with no ``rmvterm``; under P3 that is
    the usual outcome unless ``take_over=True`` is also set, which reclaims it.
    A drop inside :meth:`hand_over` reaches the handover's reader and is
    reconnected after the block; a suspended session holds no connection.

    Process exit: the library installs no ``atexit`` hook or signal handler.
    SIGKILL, ``os._exit``, a crash, default-action SIGTERM, a second SIGINT
    under :func:`asyncio.run`, an event loop stopped or shut down before
    :meth:`close` finishes, and a session dropped without :meth:`close` all
    leave the vterm held, because the HMC never releases it (P3). The next
    :meth:`open` then raises :class:`ConsoleHeldError`; ``rmvterm -m <system>
    -p <partition>`` recovers the console.

    stdin is sealed by construction (:class:`_SealedStdin`, P5/P7): no
    attribute or method of a session writes to the partition console. Only
    :class:`WritableConsoleSession` can write (ADR 0176).

    use the sealed :class:`ConsoleSession`. The stdin writer stays private, never
    sends EOF, and is replaced on every acquisition (open, resume, reconnect).
    Every write emits a ``console-write`` audit record carrying no written bytes
