# The VIOS this call mutates arrives one level below the signature —
# `storage.vios_uuid` — and is declared here as a nested selector (#260), so
# extraction, the audit record, and denial messages see it instead of only the
# managed system. The nested `adapters.vios_partition_id` selector went with the
# vSCSI step it fed (#1030). The tool stays `exhaustive_targets=False`, so only
# `targets = "all-targets"` grants it: whether a `targets` table may now bound it
# is a policy decision this removal does not make.

    Args:
        system_name_or_uuid: Target managed-system name or UUID.
        name: Name for the new logical partition.
        adapters: Virtual Ethernet attachment settings.
        storage: VIOS-backed storage mapping settings.
        resources: Memory and processor settings for the partition.
        partition_type: Partition environment: AIX/Linux, OS400, or VIOS.
        power_on: Power on the partition after configuration succeeds.
        dry_run: Validate preconditions without creating or changing resources.
        assignments: Declarative dedicated, direct SR-IOV, and vNIC requests.
        caller_token: Optional caller tracking reference embedded in the partition
            description as ``[caller <token>]`` after the ownership stamp (ADR 0064);
            1–64 printable ASCII characters, no whitespace or , = " [ ] \\.
        minimum_affinity_policy: Optional POWER11 score and deliberately selected
            action. Omission preserves HMC defaults; ``fail`` is never implicit.
        affinity_assessment: Optional target-bound captured evidence and explicit
            warning or fail response. Assessment waits for successful activation;
            omission preserves asynchronous power-on behavior.
        profile: Optional TOML profile name; uses environment defaults when omitted.

    Returns:
        A structured result with resource_created, workflow_completed, lpar_uuid,
        dry_run, ownership_stamped, steps, warnings, and change_location fields.
        With ``caller_token``, ``ownership_stamped=True`` confirms both the ownership
        stamp and the caller segment landed (one combined write); ``False`` means both
        were lost; ``None`` means the stamp was skipped — the reason is in ``warnings``.
        ``change_location`` reports where the network and storage changes
        just made now live — the partition's CurrentProfileSync and whether a later
        ``power-on --partition-profile`` would keep them; ``None`` when no adapter or
        mapping step ran, or when the read itself failed (see ``warnings``).
