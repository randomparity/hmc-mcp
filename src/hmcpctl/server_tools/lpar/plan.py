"""``hmc_plan_lpar``: the primary read-only LPAR planning tool (ADR 0198).

Planning runs only when the policy permits every delegated tool it reads, and
each read is then authorized as that tool for its system or VIOS through the
served ``dispatch_authorizer``. A handler therefore needs the application's
``permits`` and ``authorize`` gates; that is why it is built by a factory rather
than a ``tool_module`` decorator, as ``hmc_inventory`` is.

        Nothing is written or reserved; capacity is observed and may change before
        provisioning. Planning needs every tool it reads: ``hmc_list_lpars``,
        ``hmc_capacity_report``, ``hmc_list_virtual_networks``, ``hmc_list_vios`` and
        ``hmc_list_volume_groups``, plus ``hmc_list_systems`` when ``placement``
        enumerates and ``hmc_get_vios_storage_detail`` for existing storage. A withheld
        one refuses the call, naming it. Each read is then authorized as its tool for its
        system or VIOS (VIOSes by UUID), and writes its own audit record, so a placement
        call can write a few hundred. A denied target becomes a ``denied`` blocker and
        is not read; ``hmc_capacity_report`` needs an ``all-targets`` grant. Placement
        evaluates at most 16 systems and selects the tightest fit with no blocker.
        ``plan_digest`` binds the request and the selected targets; provisioning does
        not consume it until #1225.

        Args:
            name: Name for the new logical partition.
            adapters: The client virtual Ethernet adapter.
            storage: The storage to map; ``capacity_mib`` creates a new virtual disk.
            system_name_or_uuid: The managed system; exactly one of this and placement.
            placement: Choose the system from 1 to 16 selectors, or omit
                ``systems`` to enumerate the connection's systems.
            resources: Memory and processor settings for the partition.
            partition_type: AIX/Linux or OS400.
            assignments: Dedicated, direct SR-IOV, and vNIC requests.
            caller_token: Optional caller tracking reference (ADR 0064).
            minimum_affinity_policy: Optional POWER11 minimum-affinity policy.
            affinity_assessment: Optional target-bound affinity evidence; needs
                ``system_name_or_uuid``.
            power_on: Power on after configuration; omitted means true without
                ``install``. With ``install``, ``boot`` governs power-on.
            boot: ``immediate``, or ``deferred`` to stop before installer power-on.
            install: Optional operating-system installation (ADR 0194).
            exclusive_writer_window: Required true with ``install``: no other writer
                changes these VIOSes until provisioning ends.
