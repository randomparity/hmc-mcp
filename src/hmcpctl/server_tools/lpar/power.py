"""``hmc_power_lpar``: start, stop or restart an LPAR as a logical operation (ADR 0199).

Each action runs only as the specialist it uses (ADR 0189 Decision 2): ``start`` as
``hmc_power_on_lpar``, ``stop`` and ``restart`` as ``hmc_power_off_lpar``. A handler
therefore needs the application's ``permits`` and ``authorize`` gates, so it is built
by a factory, as ``hmc_plan_lpar`` is.

        Durable (ADR 0190): the call returns within ``wait_seconds`` and the work

        same arguments returns the same operation. ``start`` needs
        ``hmc_power_on_lpar`` and ``stop`` / ``restart`` need ``hmc_power_off_lpar``:
        the policy must permit that tool and admit this partition for it, or the call
        is refused and nothing is recorded. ``mode`` ``graceful`` asks the operating
        system (PowerOff ``osshutdown``, RMC must be active); ``immediate`` must be
        stated and is never chosen for you, not even after a timeout. A partition
        already in the requested state completes with ``already_in_state`` true and no
        job. The final ``result`` carries ``already_in_state``, ``observed_state``
        (host power state only, not guest readiness) and ``job_id``. A job not done in
        300 seconds, or a state that does not settle in 120 more, pauses as
        ``needs_attention``; ``continuation=resume`` re-checks without submitting again.
        A completed restart means its job succeeded and the partition reads activated,
        not that a cycle was observed; a restart whose job the HMC no longer has pauses
        on every resume and needs ``abandon``. A job that ends with warnings or is
        cancelled makes the operation failed though it may have acted: inspect first.
        An interrupted restart always needs attention: inspect the partition, then
        ``abandon``. Crash with dump is ``hmc_dump_restart_lpar``, not this tool.
