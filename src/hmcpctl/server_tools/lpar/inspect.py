"""``hmc_inspect_lpar``: the primary read-only partition inspection tool (ADR 0200).

The base read runs as ``hmc_get_lpar`` and each section as the specialist it
delegates to, through the served ``dispatch_authorizer``, so a handler needs the
application's ``permits`` and ``authorize`` gates; that is why it is built by a
factory, as ``hmc_plan_lpar`` is.
