    most-recent first, each carrying ``lpar_name``, ``time_stamp`` and
    ``refcode``. Whether an SRC is still reported once the partition reaches
    ``Running`` is reported by the caller epic (#871) and has not been
    confirmed against hardware here; #879 owns that observation.

    An empty list means no reference codes for that selector. A partition that
    does not exist is believed to answer the same way rather than failing, but
    that has not been confirmed against hardware; #879 owns the live check.

    partition-scoped read and it reaches no LED control.
