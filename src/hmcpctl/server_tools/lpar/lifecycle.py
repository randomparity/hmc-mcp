    lpar_name_or_uuid: accepts either a PartitionName or a UUID
    (find it with hmc_list_lpars). Returns ``already_running``, nullable ``job``,
    and nullable ``message`` fields. A submitted job is in ``job``; check it
    with hmc_get_job. This changes the state of a real partition — confirm the
    target with hmc_get_lpar(lpar_name_or_uuid=...) before calling.

    Two unrelated things here are called a profile. ``profile`` selects which
    configured HMC connection to use. ``partition_profile_uuid`` selects the
    partition profile the partition activates against.

    With ``partition_profile_uuid``, ``warnings`` lists each current virtual
    SCSI, Fibre Channel or Ethernet client adapter whose slot that profile lacks:
    activating the profile removes it. The job is still submitted. No warning
    covers memory or processor changes, which the profile activation discards
    too (see ``partition_profile_uuid``).

    The HMC accepts PowerOn only from the 'not activated' state. If the
    partition is already activated — 'running', 'starting' or 'open firmware' —
    ``already_running`` is true, ``job`` is null, and ``message`` names the
    state and explains that no job was submitted. Any other state is refused
    with an error naming it, and no job is submitted. Pass force=True to skip
    this check and submit PowerOn unconditionally; the HMC then fails the job
    from any state but 'not activated'.

    Set wait=True to block until the job reaches a terminal state or until
    timeout_seconds elapses; ``job`` then contains the last polled job. When the
    waited job ends successfully, the partition state is read once: 'error' or
    'not activated' is raised as a failed activation naming the state, because the
    HMC can complete the job cleanly while activation fails. Read the reference
    code with hmc_read_lpar_refcodes.

    Args:
        lpar_name_or_uuid: PartitionName or UUID of the logical partition to power on.
        wait: Whether to poll the submitted job until terminal or timed out.
        timeout_seconds: Maximum polling duration in seconds when waiting.
        poll_interval: Seconds between job polls when waiting; must be positive.

            partition profile, which is partition_profile_uuid; uses the default
            when omitted.
        system_name_or_uuid: Optional SystemName or UUID that disambiguates the
            partition name; when omitted the name is searched fleet-wide. With
            HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS set it also spares the ownership
            guard a fleet-wide search for the partition's owning system.
        affinity_assessment: Optional target-bound captured affinity evidence and
            explicit warning or fail-closed response intent.
        ownership_override: Bypass ADR 0011 ownership rejection only after operator
            approval; has no effect unless HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS is set.
        boot_mode: Boot mode to activate into — norm, dd, ds, of, or sms. Defaults
            to norm, which is what the partition activates into today. Use sms for
            System Management Services or of for the Open Firmware prompt.
        partition_profile_uuid: UUID of the partition profile to activate against.
            This is not the profile argument above, which selects a configured HMC
            connection. Activating a profile discards current-configuration
            changes the profile lacks: memory and processor changes from
            hmc_modify_lpar, hmc_dlpar_mem or hmc_dlpar_proc, and adapter changes,
            unless CurrentProfileSync was On when they were made. When omitted the
            partition activates against its current configuration.
        operation_type: PowerOn operation type; activate states the default
            explicitly. Omit it to send no OperationType parameter.
        keylock: Keylock position to activate with — manual or norm (normal), the
            PowerOn job's own spelling, not the creation-time normal/manual/auto.

    """Crash a logical partition and take a platform dump (PowerOff operation=dumprestart).

    This is kdive's force-crash. It is a separate tool from hmc_power_off_lpar so an
    access policy can grant the ordinary stop without it (ADR 0188). It is refused
    unless allow_dump_restart is true. Returns the submitted job; with wait=True it
    blocks until the job is terminal. Do not resubmit a timed-out wait: poll the job.

    Args:
        lpar_name_or_uuid: PartitionName or UUID of the logical partition to crash.
        allow_dump_restart: Confirm the crash and platform dump; without it the call is
            refused and nothing is submitted.
        wait: Whether to poll the submitted job until terminal or timed out.
        timeout_seconds: Maximum polling duration in seconds when waiting.
        poll_interval: Seconds between job polls when waiting; must be positive.
        profile: Optional configured HMC profile name; uses the default when omitted.
        system_name_or_uuid: Optional SystemName or UUID used to disambiguate its name.
            With HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS set it also spares the ownership
            guard a fleet-wide search for the partition's owning system.
        ownership_override: Bypass ADR 0011 ownership rejection only after operator
            approval; has no effect unless HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS is set.
