    """List this agent's logical operations, newest first, from the local operation store.

    Reads only the store in ``HMCPCTL_STATE_DIR`` (or the platform state directory); it
    makes no HMC call and never creates the store, so an empty page means no operation has
    been recorded. Only records whose agent id matches the selected profile's ``agent_id``
    (``hmcpctl`` when unset) and whose connection is this call's profile (or the
    environment connection when ``profile`` is omitted) are returned. A lookup by
    ``operation_id`` or ``request_id`` returns at most one record. Each record carries its
    effects, its newest 200 events with ``events_truncated``, its warnings, and
    ``next_actions``: the continuations its state accepts. Pass ``next_cursor`` back as
    ``cursor`` for the next page.

    Args:
        operation_id: Optional operation id (32 lower-case hex digits) to look up.
        request_id: Optional caller request id to look up.
        state: Optional state filter: running, interrupted, paused or terminal.
        outcome: Optional outcome filter, such as needs_attention or completed.
        limit: Page size, 1 to 50.
        cursor: Optional ``next_cursor`` from a previous page.
        profile: Optional configured HMC profile name; selects the agent id and the
            connection this call is authorized against.
