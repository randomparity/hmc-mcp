# 0233 — CLI TLS diagnostic presentation

## Status

Accepted. Implements #1700 within #1695; complements ADR 0224.

## Context

The CLI prints Python warning locations and source lines, and unconfigured
logging prints TLS audit JSON through `lastResort`. The migration warning also
suggests a Boolean assignment the parser rejects. Warnings and audit events
have different lifetimes: logon warnings are throttled, audit is per construction.

## Decision

The existing CLI coroutine boundary temporarily formats the two TLS warning
categories as concise prose, retaining separate migration information and
executable `--verify-ssl` / `--no-verify-ssl` suggestions. Library warning
categories, warning filters, and client throttle ownership remain unchanged.

The audit sink owner supplies a scoped fallback handler only when the reserved
logger has no reachable configured handler. It retains the logger's level and
propagation policy. The handler uses the existing bounded sink and is removed
and flushed on exit. For actual stderr TTYs, the known TLS event becomes a
compact audit line containing its event identity, timestamp, host and source.
For redirected stderr, unknown shapes and other events, preserve the original
JSON message. The emitted LogRecord remains unchanged; configured sinks retain
it unchanged. This is a CLI display policy, not a change to ADR 0040's record
grammar or the server sink. No record is filtered or deduplicated here.

## Consequences

Interactive TLS diagnostics lose JSON punctuation and Python source boilerplate.
Redirected audit records remain machine-readable. Repeated clients still emit
separate audit events. The synchronous CLI invocation scopes formatter changes;
embedding concurrent CLI invocations in one interpreter is not supported.

## Considered & rejected

- **Leave output unchanged.** verified: a controlled `CliRunner` invocation on
  c11fc37e emits two filename/source warning blocks and audit JSON before its
  error; `--verify-ssl=false` exits 2 under Python 3.11.15.
- **Suppress audit or install a quiet switch.** verified: #1700 and ADR 0224
  require retained audit emission and security warnings.
- **Add a log file destination.** judgment: a new retention and failure contract
  is unnecessary when the existing logger and sink preserve the events.
