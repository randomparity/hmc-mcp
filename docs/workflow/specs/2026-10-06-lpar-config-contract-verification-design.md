# LPAR configuration, DLPAR and boot-order contract verification (V2b)

Issue #1345 (split from #626, epic #620). Pattern: #627 / PR #1320, #629 / PR #1361.

## Problem

Eight registered operations in this slice have no maturity record, and their
`docs/capabilities/operations.json` rows are a bulk assignment naming CLI commands
(`chlparstate`, `migrlpar`, `lpar-netboot`) and REST jobs that none of them issue.
The only live coverage is ST8's `hmc_modify_lpar` call, which declares an expected
HTTP 406 (`_REST_MODIFY_UNSUPPORTED`). That declaration predates the read-modify-write
write path (`HMCClient.update_logical_partition`, ADR 0171 terms), and it turns any 406
into a SKIP and a gap row instead of a failure. Nothing exercises rename, DLPAR, or
boot order on hardware, and nothing records the activated-partition case #1170 raises.

## Operations in scope

Selector resolution (system and partition reads) and the ADR 0092 ownership read are
shared plumbing and are not bound, as in PR #1320 and PR #1361.

| Operation | Issues | Rows bound | Implemented variant(s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `lpar.modify` | `LogicalPartition` GET + POST (`If-Match`); assignments delegate to `pcie.assign_dedicated_slot`, `sriov.assign_logical_port`, `vnic.add` | `rest:managed-system/logical-partition` | `resource-read-modify-write`, `delegated-pcie-assignments` |
| `lpar.rename` | same GET + POST | same | `name-read-modify-write` |
| `lpar.dlpar_proc` | same | same | `processor-read-modify-write` |
| `lpar.dlpar_mem` | same | same | `memory-read-modify-write` |
| `boot_order.set` | same, `BootListInformation/PendingBootString` | same | `pending-boot-string` |
| `boot_order.clear` | ownership read only, then refuses (#1048) | same | `authorized-refusal`; missing `clear-pending-boot-order` (state `partial`) |
| `lpar.set_minimum_affinity_policy` | `lssyscfg` (capability), `chsyscfg` | `cli:commands/lssyscfg`, `cli:commands/chsyscfg` | `power11-capability-gated` |
| `system.modify` | `ManagedSystem` POST | `rest:managed-system` | `managed-system-attributes` |

Criterion 1 is met for `lpar.modify`'s resource path. Its assignment step reuses the
`pcie.assign_dedicated_slot`, `sriov.assign_logical_port` and `vnic.add` operations,
whose own rows are still the bulk assignment; binding them belongs to #630, and
`lpar.modify` gains those rows when #630 lands. Copying the delegates' current rows
would bind commands nobody issues.

## Design

1. **Arm `lpar-config`, subtask 39** (orchestrator-assigned). `SUBTASKS[39]` dispatches
   `exercise_lpar_config` in a new module `scripts/live_test/lpar_config.py`;
   `SUBTASK_GROUPS["lpar-config"] = [39]`, not in `all`; the subtask SKIPs unless
   `state.group == "lpar-config"`. Wrapper `scripts/live_lpar_config.py`, tested by
   `tests/scripts/test_live_lpar_config.py`. Preflight lists what it mutates.
2. **Scratch partition.** Name `hmcpctl-live-lpar-<8 hex>`, caller token
   `lparcfg-<8 hex>` (same hex), created through `hmc_create_lpar` with explicit
   resources: memory 1024/2048/4096 MiB, shared uncapped, 0.1/0.5/1.0 processing units,
   1/1/2 virtual processors. The arm creates nothing while any partition named
   `hmcpctl-live-lpar-*` exists on the system. Every call names the partition by UUID
   and the system by name, except rename's by-name checks.
3. **Baseline and compare.** Before the create the arm reads, through `hmc_run_command`:
   `lssyscfg -r lpar -m <sys> -F name`, `lshwres -r proc -m <sys> --level sys -F
   curr_avail_sys_proc_units`, `lshwres -r mem -m <sys> --level sys -F
   curr_avail_sys_mem,mem_region_size`. After the delete it reads the first three again
   and records `system baseline compare` PASS only when each equals the baseline (the
   name list as a set). When a read differs it waits 30 s and reads once more; the row
   carries both reads, and only the second decides. A failed baseline read SKIPs the
   arm before any create.
4. **Read-back.** Each postcondition reads `hmc_get_lpar` (UUID + system) and takes leaf
   text from `Resource/PartitionMemoryConfiguration/{Minimum,Desired,Maximum}Memory` and
   `Resource/PartitionProcessorConfiguration/SharedProcessorConfiguration/
   {Desired,Maximum}{ProcessingUnits,VirtualProcessors}`, compared numerically
   (`float`). The boot order reads `hmc_read_lpar_boot_order`.
5. **Not Activated cases** (`R` = `mem_region_size` from the baseline):
   - `lpar.modify`: desired memory `2048 + R`, maximum memory `4096 + R` and desired
     units `0.6` in one call; assertions `memory-read-back`,
     `processing-units-read-back`. This call is criterion 3's re-capture of the
     declared 406 (ST8's call changes desired and maximum memory the same way).
   - `lpar.dlpar_mem`: small (`desired + R`), large (`desired = max`), no-op (current
     desired again), empty request; assertions `small-change-read-back`,
     `large-change-read-back`, `no-op-accepted-unchanged`, `empty-request-refused`.
     Then over-maximum (`max + R`) is a non-promoting row recording the HMC's answer and
     the read-back.
   - `lpar.dlpar_proc`: small (units `+0.1`), large (units and virtual processors at
     their maximum), no-op, empty request; the same four assertion ids.
   - `lpar.rename`: to `<name>-rn`, then back; assertions `renamed-same-uuid`,
     `old-name-absent`, `ownership-stamp-kept`, `original-name-restored`.
   - `boot_order.set`: two Open Firmware paths; assertion `pending-boot-string-read-back`
     (the pending string equals the space-joined paths).
   - `boot_order.clear`: assertions `clear-refused-after-authorization` (the call fails
     with the #1048 refusal text) and `pending-boot-string-unchanged`.
   An empty request is a tool-side refusal: its assertion holds only on a FAIL whose
   message names "Nothing to change". Every absence check (rename's old name, the
   delete) follows `pcie.name_absent`'s rule: an HSCL8012 answer is believed only when a
   second read after the same delay agrees (#906).
6. **Activated cases (#1170).** Read the associated profile UUID from `hmc_get_lpar`
   (`AssociatedPartitionProfile`), power on to SMS with `wait=True`, poll
   `hmc_get_lpar_state` until `open firmware` or `running`; if it never gets there the
   DLPAR calls are skipped with a SKIP row. Then one small `dlpar_mem` and one small
   `dlpar_proc`, each a `state.record` row (never an observation) carrying the call's
   answer, the tool's `change_location`, and a read-back that adds the `Current*`
   leaves (`CurrentMemory`, `CurrentProcessingUnits`). The row's note follows the
   answer: a refusal is recorded verbatim as the activated-DLPAR gap; an acceptance
   says whether the `Current*` value moved. Power off immediately, wait for
   `not activated`. Power calls are `state.record` rows: lifecycle evidence is #1346's.
   The live answer, whichever it is, is copied into the Live gaps table and the
   runbook section after the run.
7. **Teardown.** When the create response carries no UUID, the arm looks the name up
   and accepts it only with this run's caller token (the `_created_despite_failure`
   shape, #906). It powers the partition off when it is not `not activated`, deletes by
   UUID only when the description still carries this run's caller token, and confirms
   absence. Every exit with the partition not confirmed deleted (unknown UUID, power-off
   failure, foreign token, delete refused, absence unconfirmed) records one
   `MANUAL RECOVERY REQUIRED` row naming the shutdown and `rmsyscfg` commands.
   Observations are recorded after teardown, at literal `record_verified` call sites
   (as `users.py` does), with `cleanup="passed"` only when the delete is confirmed and
   the baseline compare holds; otherwise `"failed"`.
8. **ST8.** Drop `_REST_MODIFY_UNSUPPORTED`; ST8 records its modify call with
   `state.record`, so a 406 is a FAIL row, never a gap.
9. **Recovery.** `live_test_recovery.py` witnesses subtask 39: any partition named
   `hmcpctl-live-lpar-*` in `lssyscfg -r lpar -m <sys> -F name,state` is stranded; the
   finding prints `chsysstate ... -o shutdown --immed` (when not `Not Activated`) and
   `rmsyscfg -r lpar -m <sys> -n <name>`. The reserved prefix is the identity, as the
   users arm's is for HMC users: nothing else may create a partition under it.
10. **Catalog.** Rebind the rows above; add the eight maturity records; copy each
    emitted observation unchanged (ADR 0126); regenerate the runtime projection and
    `docs/tools/`; `CHANGELOG.md`; `docs/live-testing.md` gets an arm section, a row in
    the arm table and the recovery table.

Defects the live run confirms inside `src/hmcpctl/operations/lpar/` are fixed here; one
in `client/` or `documents/` is reported to the orchestrator before any edit.

## Live gaps (durable record)

| Case | Prerequisite | State |
|---|---|---|
| DLPAR on an activated partition | a partition with an OS and an active RMC connection, if the live answer is a refusal | filled from the live answer; not promoted |
| `lpar.set_minimum_affinity_policy` | a writable POWER11 system (the POWER11 HMC is read-only) | not run |
| `system.modify` | an operator window for a system-wide setting change | not run |
| `lpar.modify` assignments and their rows | the delegate operations' slice (#630) | not run here |
| clearing a pending boot order | an HMC release that accepts a clear value (#1048) | not available |

## Success

- The eight operations carry the rows and variants in the table, and a maturity record.
- The six operations exercised by the arm carry one live observation each, emitted by a
  run at the branch's final `src/` closure and copied with its emitted result.
- After the run the system's partition-name set and available processing units and
  memory equal the pre-run read, and no `hmcpctl-live-lpar-*` partition exists
  (recovery exit 0 for subtask 39).
- Every mutating call the arm makes names the scratch partition's UUID (rename's
  `new_name` aside), checked by a unit test over the scripted HMC.
- `just verify` and `uv run --no-sync prek run --all-files` pass.

## Failure model

1. **Actors and deployments:**
   - a local operator dispatching `scripts/live_lpar_config.py` from the live-test host
     against the V10R3 HMC and POWER9 boundary system;
   - CI, offline (unit tests with a fake client).
2. **Invariants and assets:**
   - every partition other than the scratch one, including the VIOS and the test
     partition: untouched;
   - the system's processor and memory pools return to the baseline;
   - the honesty of `maturity.json`: no observation from a SKIP, a transport success,
     or a submitted job.
3. **Accepted failure classes:**
   - An interrupted run can leave the scratch partition, possibly activated. Cost bounded
     to one small partition; recovery names it by prefix and prints the commands.
   - A concurrent change by another operator, or pool accounting that lags the delete by
     more than the one re-read, fails the compare; the run is then not clean and is
     re-run, never patched.
   - A partition someone else creates under the reserved prefix is reported by
     recovery as stranded; the prefix is documented as reserved.
   - The activated case runs in firmware only; DLPAR with RMC stays a gap.
4. **Covered elsewhere:**
   - power and lifecycle contracts (#1346); missing configuration fields (#638); profile
     CRUD (#637);
   - authorization semantics (ADR 0092, unchanged); environment isolation of tests (#461).
