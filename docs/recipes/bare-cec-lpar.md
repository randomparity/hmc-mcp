This recipe brings up one Linux LPAR that uses no VIOS, shared storage, or virtual network. It
creates the partition, gives it a dedicated physical PCIe slot, activates it to the SMS menu,
observes it, and tears it down. The steps follow the `bare-cec` live-test arm
(`scripts/live_test/bare_cec.py`). Every command below mutates only the partition this run
creates and the one slot you select.

## Prerequisites

- A connection profile for an HMC and managed system you own. Dedicated slot assignment is
  admitted only for HMC V10R3 M1060 with managed-system model 8375-42A (ADR 0165). Outside that
  envelope, `network assign-dedicated-pcie-slot` refuses.
- One dedicated PCIe slot that no partition owns. You pick it in step 1.
- `HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS=true`. This is optional for the CLI but the live window runs
  under it. It turns on the ownership guard for power commands, so `power-on` and `power-off`
  refuse a partition another owner stamped. Every power command below passes `--system`, so
  the guard checks that system instead of searching the fleet. Never add
  `--ownership-override` to these commands.

```bash
export HMC_PROFILE=<profile-name>
export HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS=true
SYSTEM_NAME=<managed-system-name>
LPAR_NAME=<new-lpar-name>
RUN_TOKEN=<run-unique-token>
hmcpctl config show
hmcpctl systems show "$SYSTEM_NAME" --json
SYSTEM=<managed-system-uuid-from-UUID-field>
```

`config show` should list the intended profile with `authorize_power_operations` set to `True`.
`systems show` prints the managed system as JSON; copy its `UUID` into `SYSTEM`.

## 1. Inventory the dedicated slots

```bash
hmcpctl network list-dedicated-pcie-slots "$SYSTEM" --json
DRC_INDEX=<drc-index-of-an-unowned-slot>
```

Expected: `capability` is `"available"` and `items` lists slots with `drc_index`, `description`,
and `owner_lpar`. Pick a slot whose `owner_lpar` is `null`. Record its `drc_index`.

## 2. Create the partition

`lpars create` refuses more than one virtual processor without processing units, so pass all
three resource axes explicitly. These are the arm's values.

```bash
hmcpctl lpars create "$LPAR_NAME" --system "$SYSTEM" \
  --min-mem 1024 --mem 2048 --max-mem 4096 \
  --min-procs 0.1 --procs 0.5 --max-procs 1.0 \
  --min-vcpus 1 --vcpus 1 --max-vcpus 1 \
  --caller-token "$RUN_TOKEN" --yes
hmcpctl lpars state "$LPAR_NAME"
```

Expected: `Created LPAR '<new-lpar-name>'` and the partition as JSON; copy its `UUID` into
`LPAR`. `lpars state` prints `not activated`.

The command writes one partition profile, `default_profile`. The HMC gives the partition a
current configuration only when that profile is applied or the partition is activated with
it. Until then the JSON above shows zero memory and processors. No installed command applies a
profile without powering the partition on (#939). This recipe's path is step 4, which activates
against the profile.

## 3. Assign the dedicated slot

```bash
LPAR=<lpar-uuid-from-create-output>
hmcpctl network assign-dedicated-pcie-slot "$SYSTEM_NAME" "$LPAR" default_profile "$DRC_INDEX"
```

Expected: no output and exit status 0. The command writes the slot into `default_profile` and
verifies it by exact profile readback. It refuses unless the partition is `not activated`, and
a readback that does not match exits non-zero.

## 4. Activate to SMS

A PowerOn names its partition profile by UUID. Read it from the partition.

```bash
hmcpctl lpars show "$LPAR" --json
PROFILE_UUID=<uuid-at-the-end-of-AssociatedPartitionProfile-href>
hmcpctl lpars power-on "$LPAR" --system "$SYSTEM" \
  --partition-profile "$PROFILE_UUID" --boot-mode sms \
  --wait --timeout 900 --interval 5 --yes
```

Expected: `lpars show` prints the partition, whose `AssociatedPartitionProfile` link ends in the
profile UUID. `power-on` prints `Job submitted for <lpar-uuid>` and the finished job as JSON;
its status is `COMPLETED_OK`. Copy the job's `JobID` into `JOB_ID`.

A PowerOn that names no profile is not a substitute. The arm records it expecting an `HSCL3680`
refusal on a partition that has never been activated; #879 confirms that outcome.

## 5. Observe the partition

```bash
JOB_ID=<job-id-from-power-on-output>
hmcpctl jobs show "$JOB_ID"
hmcpctl lpars state "$LPAR"
hmcpctl lpars refcodes "$SYSTEM_NAME" "$LPAR_NAME" --count 5 --json
CONSOLE_LOG=<new-file-for-the-console-bytes>
hmcpctl lpars capture-console "$LPAR_NAME" --system "$SYSTEM_NAME" --duration 30 \
  --max-bytes 65536 --idle-timeout 10 --output "$CONSOLE_LOG"
```

Expected: `jobs show` prints the same job, found, with a successful status. `lpars state`
prints `open firmware` while the partition sits at the SMS menu, or `running`. `lpars refcodes`
prints up to five recent reference codes for the partition.

`lpars capture-console` records the console for at most 30 seconds or 64 KiB, stopping after 10
seconds without output, and never sends input. It writes the raw bytes to `CONSOLE_LOG`, which
must not exist yet, and prints one line to stderr, for example
`stop reason: idle; bytes: 2048; released: true`. The bytes carry terminal escape sequences:
read them with `less -R` or a log viewer. Exit status 3 means `released: false`: the console
may still be held, so run the `rmvterm` command the line names on the HMC before another capture.
Exit status 1 with a message that the console is held means another session has it open.

## 6. Power off

```bash
hmcpctl lpars power-off "$LPAR" --system "$SYSTEM" --immediate \
  --wait --timeout 900 --interval 5 --yes
hmcpctl lpars state "$LPAR"
```

Expected: `Job submitted for <lpar-uuid>` with a successful job, then `not activated`. Do not
continue until the state reads `not activated`: unassign refuses an active partition.

## 7. Unassign the slot

Confirm the partition is the one this run created before each destructive step. The
description must carry `[caller <run-unique-token>]`.

```bash
hmcpctl lpars get-description "$LPAR_NAME" "$SYSTEM_NAME"
hmcpctl network unassign-dedicated-pcie-slot "$SYSTEM_NAME" "$LPAR" default_profile "$DRC_INDEX"
```

Expected: the description shows the owner stamp and your caller token; stop if it does not.
The unassign prints nothing and exits 0 after its readback shows the slot gone from the profile.

## 8. Delete the partition

```bash
hmcpctl lpars get-description "$LPAR_NAME" "$SYSTEM_NAME"
hmcpctl lpars delete "$LPAR" --system "$SYSTEM" --yes
hmcpctl lpars show "$LPAR_NAME" --json
hmcpctl network list-dedicated-pcie-slots "$SYSTEM" --json
```

Expected: the description again carries your caller token. `lpars delete` prints
`Deleted LPAR <lpar-uuid>`. `lpars show` then reports the partition as not found and exits
non-zero. The slot list shows the `DRC_INDEX` slot with `owner_lpar` `null`.

## Recovery

If a step fails, stop and keep the transcript. Read `lpars state "$LPAR"` before deciding
anything. A partition that is not `not activated` must be powered off (step 6) before unassign
or delete. If the caller-token readback does not match, touch nothing and investigate.
