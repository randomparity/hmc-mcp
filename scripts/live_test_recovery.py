"""Confirm from outside a run that it left nothing behind.

Arm cleanup guards refuse to mutate on a mismatch and emit a manual-recovery
row, which is correct. But the only witness that recovery happened is the same
run that failed to complete it. This script is the outside witness.

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_test_recovery.py --results PATH

It witnesses the dedicated PCIe and bare-cec arms (subtasks 24-25) by their run
marker, the users arm (subtask 11) by any HMC user still carrying its reserved
`hmcpctl-live-` prefix, and the vMedia arm (subtasks 16-22) by what it can leave on the run's
configured test partition: a running partition, a changed pending boot string,
an optical mapping, a VIOS vSCSI server adapter with no mapping, a medium it
created, and the media repository it created. It witnesses the vios-backup arm (subtask 37) by the backup
and disk mapping that run recorded: a backup still in the catalog (remedy:
`rmviosbk`) and a disk mapping not put back (remedy: `mkvdev`). It witnesses
the network arm (subtask 9) by the baselines that run recorded: a network left on
its test VLAN, a client adapter on the test partition off its baseline, an FC-port
label off its original, and a vFC group label it named. Subtask 2 only reads, so
there is nothing for it to leave. It witnesses the lpar-config arm (subtask 39) by
any partition still carrying its reserved `hmcpctl-live-lpar-` prefix, and the
lpar-power arm (subtask 41) by a `hmcpctl-live-pwr-` partition, a VIOS mapping backed
by an `lppwr` volume, an `lppwr` volume left in the configured volume group, or a VIOS
vSCSI adapter serving a `hmcpctl-live-pwr-` partition. Every other
subtask the run dispatched is listed as NOT WITNESSED, to be checked by hand
(docs/live-testing.md, step 4).

Exit 0 means every dispatched subtask was witnessed and nothing is stranded.
Exit 1 means something is, and the output names it with the command that
clears it. Exit 2 means some state could not be read, or the run dispatched a
subtask this script does not witness, which is not the same as clean. A run
that an exception or interrupt stopped (`run.partial` present and not `false`)
also exits 2 whatever the checks found, under a PARTIAL header: the call in
flight at the stop has no row, so what it changed is never checked.

**This never remediates.** It issues no mutating call: a remediator acting on
a partial read strands exactly what the arm's cleanup guards exist to refuse.
Every command it prints is for a human to run and check.

Its inputs come from the run's own results document: `run.subtasks`, the
`config` the run used, and its `artifacts` and result rows. The PCIe marker is
per-run random (`pcie-<8 hex>`), so a run's traces cannot be identified without
them.
