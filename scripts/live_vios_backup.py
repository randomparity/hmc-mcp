"""Run the vios-backup arm of the live integration suite against a real HMC.

Covers subtask 37: a viosioconfig backup of the VIOS serving the test
partition, removal of that partition's disk VTD, a restore that may restart
the VIOS, and removal of the backup (issue #1349). No other arm restores a
VIOS's I/O configuration.

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_vios_backup.py

Equivalent to `live_test_runner.py --group vios-backup`, and named so that an
operator picking an arm from the runbook cannot mistype the group or land on
a different one. Results go to `test-results-vios-backup.json`.

**This mutates a managed system.** Run `scripts/live_test_preflight.py
--group vios-backup` first to see what it will touch.

Takes no options: everything else about a run is configuration, and the
runner itself is there for an invocation this does not cover.
