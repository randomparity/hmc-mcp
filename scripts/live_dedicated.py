"""Run the dedicated arm of the live integration suite against a real HMC.

Covers subtask 24: dedicated PCIe slot assignment and teardown (issue #217).

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_dedicated.py

Equivalent to `live_test_runner.py --group dedicated`, and named so that an
operator picking an arm from the runbook cannot mistype the group or land on
a different one. Results go to `test-results-dedicated.json`.

**This mutates a managed system.** Run `scripts/live_test_preflight.py
--group dedicated` first to see what it will touch.

Takes no options: everything else about a run is configuration, and the
runner itself is there for an invocation this does not cover.
