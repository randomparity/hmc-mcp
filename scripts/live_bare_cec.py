"""Run the bare-CEC arm of the live integration suite against a real HMC.

Covers subtask 25: create a partition, give it a dedicated slot, activate it to
SMS, observe it, exercise the power-off variants, and delete it (issue #876).

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_bare_cec.py

Equivalent to `live_test_runner.py --group bare-cec`, and named so that an
operator picking an arm from the runbook cannot mistype the group or land on
a different one. Results go to `test-results-bare-cec.json`.

**This mutates a managed system**: it creates, powers on and deletes a
partition. Run `scripts/live_test_preflight.py --group bare-cec` first to see
what it will touch.

Takes no options: everything else about a run is configuration, and the
runner itself is there for an invocation this does not cover.
