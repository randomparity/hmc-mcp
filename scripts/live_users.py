"""Run the users arm of the live integration suite against a real HMC.

Covers subtask 11: the user, task-role, resource-role and remote-access reads,
then one scratch user's create, read, modify, clear and delete (issue #632). It
is the only arm that creates an HMC user. The user is named
`hmcpctl-live-<8 hex>`, has the viewer task role and no remote access, and is
deleted by UUID in the same run.

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_users.py

Equivalent to `live_test_runner.py --group users`, and named so that an
operator picking an arm from the runbook cannot mistype the group or land on
a different one. Results go to `test-results-users.json`.

**This mutates a managed system's HMC.** Run `scripts/live_test_preflight.py
--group users` first to see what it will touch.

Takes no options: everything else about a run is configuration, and the
runner itself is there for an invocation this does not cover.
