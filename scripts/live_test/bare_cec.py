"""Bare-CEC live arm — issue #876 (dispatched as subtask 25, recorded as rows 35).

Creates a run-unique owner-stamped partition, gives it a dedicated slot through
`hmc_assign_dedicated_pcie_slot`, records a PowerOn with no partition profile,
activates it to SMS against its own profile, inspects that job, reads its
reference codes, captures its console, exercises the PowerOff variants, then
unassigns and deletes it. Every promoting step goes through `record_verified`,
under scenario `st35-bare-cec`.

Design: docs/workflow/specs/2026-09-22-bare-cec-live-arm-design.md. The
configuration, baseline, fixture-create and cleanup guards are the dedicated
arm's (`pcie.py`, ADR 0163), so preflight and `live_test_recovery.py` read this
arm exactly as they read that one. Its own rows are numbered 35; the shared
helpers keep writing rows 29, 30 and 34 with their dedicated-arm wording.

Configuration, from the ADR 0115 `.env`:
  LIVE_TEST_DEDICATED_PCIE_* — the dedicated arm's four keys, unchanged
  LIVE_TEST_ACCEPT_PLATFORM_DUMP — `true` runs the dumprestart step; `false` or
      unset SKIPs it; any other value SKIPs the arm

The arm runs only when `HMC_AUTHORIZE_POWER_OPERATIONS` is on, so the evidence
covers the ownership-guarded power path.
