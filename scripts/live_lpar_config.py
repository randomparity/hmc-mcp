"""Run the lpar-config arm of the live integration suite against a real HMC.

Covers subtask 39: it creates one scratch partition named
`hmcpctl-live-lpar-<8 hex>`, changes its memory, processors, name and boot
order, activates it to SMS for the activated DLPAR case, then deletes it
(issue #1345). It touches no other partition.

Usage:
    uv run --no-sync python scripts/live_lpar_config.py

Equivalent to `live_test_runner.py --group lpar-config`, and named so that an
operator picking an arm from the runbook cannot mistype the group or land on a
different one. Results go to `test-results-lpar-config.json`.

**This mutates a managed system.** Run `scripts/live_test_preflight.py
--group lpar-config` first to see what it will touch.

Takes no options: everything else about a run is configuration, and the
runner itself is there for an invocation this does not cover.
