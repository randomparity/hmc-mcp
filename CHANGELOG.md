# Changelog

All notable user-facing changes to this project are recorded in this file. The format is
based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/): changes collect under
`[Unreleased]` in its usual categories until a release is cut. Each release's entry keeps those
itemized changes and adds a scope statement, a **Verified** section naming the operations
verified live for it, and a **Known issues** section. The entry is also the GitHub release body.

0.1.0 is the exception. As the first release it has no itemized changes: nothing shipped before
it, and its pre-release development history is in the git history, not in this file.

The six-name `hmcpctl.api` facade is defined by ADR 0118; record changes to it under ordinary
release categories. Domain-module APIs remain pre-release and are not facade movement.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `scripts/live_test_baseline.py` captures private, read-only live-window baselines
  and compares independent before/after state, including explicitly selected VIOS
  mappings and volume-group volumes (#1479).

### Changed

- The `app` extra now pins `fastmcp-slim[server]==4.0.10`, up from 4.0.3; `mcp` and `mcp-types`
  stay at 2.2.0 (#1539).
- Generated tool-reference verification retains the last release’s state regardless of the
  rendering date, with a regression check spanning more than 90 days (#1509).
- CLI and MCP capability discovery retain the last release’s verification state, initially
  v0.1.0, without runtime age decay. Ordinary capability metadata regeneration combines current
  catalog structure with the committed release snapshot; explicit `--release` inventory and
  artifact checks detect candidate closure drift (#1508).
- `hmc_provision_lpar` and `hmcpctl lpars provision` refuse a dedicated PCIe slot
  (`assignments.dedicated`) before any HMC call, dry runs included. Provision powers on the
  current configuration, so a slot written into the new profile was never owned by the
  running partition: the 0.1.0 known issue (#1390). To give a new partition a dedicated slot,
  create it with `hmc_create_lpar` (optionally with `assignments.dedicated`) or assign the slot
  with `hmc_assign_dedicated_pcie_slot`, then power on with the partition profile, as the
  [bare-CEC LPAR recipe](docs/recipes/bare-cec-lpar.md) does. Profile-first provisioning, which
  would lift the refusal, is tracked in #1225.
- `hmc_remove_memory_pool` and `hmcpctl memory-pools remove` no longer take a pool name. A
  managed system has at most one shared memory pool, so the remove now sends the documented
  `chhwres -r mempool -m <system> -o r`. It refuses when the system has no pool, and when any
  partition or profile does not report `mem_mode=ded` (#1245).
- `hmc_create_lpar`'s duplicate-name check and read-back, and `hmc_provision_lpar`'s duplicate-name
  check, read the target managed system instead of searching the HMC, so they refuse before any
  write when the target cannot be read. A partition of the same name on another managed system no
  longer blocks the create. An unscoped lookup of such a name reports the ambiguity, except while
  one of the two systems cannot be read, when it finds the other; pass the system selector (#1309).
- `hmcpctl.documents` no longer re-exports its builders: import each from its owning submodule.
  The logon document builder is now in `hmcpctl.documents.logon` and the RemoteAccess builders
  in `hmcpctl.documents.remote_access`; `hmcpctl.documents.access` keeps the UserProfile builder.
  A change to the UserProfile builder no longer marks every operation's live verification
  stale, only those of the operations that import it (#1495).

### Fixed

- A failed vSCSI or virtual-optical mapping create no longer says that `list-mappings` does not
  show a leftover VIOS server adapter. A partition-scoped listing omits it, an unscoped one
  shows it with no identity, and `hmc_list_optical_mappings` never shows it. The note still
  points at the `lshwres` server-adapter listing (#1537).
- `hmc_create_lpar` and `hmc_provision_lpar` refuse promptly when the target managed system is not
  operating. Their name check, and every listing or lookup that finds a system's partition or VIOS
  feed empty, now reads the system's `State` from `ManagedSystem/quick/All` instead of
  `ManagedSystem/{uuid}`, which can stall for a system with no connection until `HMC_TIMEOUT`. The
  error names the system, its `State` and any non-blank `StateDetail` (it no longer carries
  `DetailedState`), and asks you to retry when the system reconnects (#1500).
- A managed system given by name is resolved from `ManagedSystem/quick/All` instead of the
  `SystemName` search, and an ambiguous LPAR or VIOS name without a managed-system selector finds
  each candidate's system from `quick/All` and reads only the operating systems. Both stalled for
  minutes on an HMC with a system in `No Connection`. A candidate found on no operating system
  now names the systems that were not read (#1501).
- Tools that turn a managed-system UUID into its name for an HMC CLI command, or for the LPAR
  ownership check, read it from `ManagedSystem/quick/All` instead of `ManagedSystem/{uuid}`,
  which stalled for a system in `No Connection` (#1501).
- Fleet health, the capacity report and placement, the utilization report, and the
  owning-system search a DLPAR or power operation runs without a managed-system selector take
  their systems from `ManagedSystem/quick/All` instead of the full `ManagedSystem` feed, which
  stalled for minutes while a system was in `No Connection`. The owning-system search names a
  frame that refuses its partitions with its state. Capacity and utilization do not read a
  system that is not operating: capacity leaves it out, and the utilization report lists it
  with every figure unknown and a gap naming its state (#1501).
- `hmc_list_systems`, `hmc_get_system`, `systems list` and `systems show` take their systems from
  `ManagedSystem/quick/All`. They read a system's full entry only while it is operating. A system
  that is not operating, for example in `No Connection`, still appears, with a partial entry: its
  `UUID`, and `SystemName`, `State` and `StateDetail` under `Resource`. The `state` filter matches
  `State` exactly instead of calling the HMC's `State` search. `hmc_inventory` and
  `hmc_plan_lpar` find their systems the same way. `hmc_system_summary`, `hmc_backup_vios` with a
  system UUID, and snapshot capture refuse a system that is not operating at once, naming its
  state, instead of waiting for its entry to time out (#1501).
- A partition or VIOS name lookup without a managed-system selector no longer reports a name as
  not found while a managed system cannot be read. The HMC-wide name search answers "not found"
  for a partition on a system in `No Connection`, so a miss now reads the managed-system summary
  and, when any system is not `operating`, fails with an error naming those systems and asking for
  a system selector. When every system operates, not-found is unchanged. This resolves the 0.1.0
  known issue (#1309).
- `hmc_list_lpars`, `hmc_list_vios` and `hmc_list_lpar_ownership` without a system no longer hang
  while a managed system is in `No Connection`: they take the system list from the managed-system
  summary rather than the full managed-system feed, which times out there. An unreadable system's
  `detailed_state` now comes from that summary (#1309).
- `hmc_list_memory_pools` no longer documents pool row field names that no capture has
  confirmed (#1245).
- Creating an HMC user with `remote_user_id` no longer fails with REST0001 on V10R3: the
  `UserProfile` document now sends `RemoteUserID` where the HMC's schema expects it, before
  `AssociatedTaskRole` (#1414). A modify builds the same document; only the create was run live.
- Creating an HMC user without a description no longer fails with REST0344 on V10R3: the create
  now describes the user as `HMC User`, the HMC's own default (#1414). Modifying a user without a
  description still leaves it unchanged.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-10-12

First tagged release of `hmcpctl`: a CLI, an MCP server and a Python library for the IBM HMC.
It is scoped to two paths. The first is the Tier A contract a kdive host provider relies on to
adopt an existing partition: power, state readback, console capture and job polling
([kdive Tier A contract](https://github.com/randomparity/hmcpctl/blob/v0.1.0/docs/kdive-tier-a-contract.md)). The second is the Tier B bare-CEC
path, which creates an LPAR, gives it a dedicated PCIe slot, activates it and deletes it
([bare-CEC LPAR recipe](https://github.com/randomparity/hmcpctl/blob/v0.1.0/docs/recipes/bare-cec-lpar.md)). The stable Python API is the
six-name `hmcpctl.api` facade of ADR 0118. Every other module is a pre-release domain API. The
pre-release development history is in the git history, not in this file.

### Verified

These 15 operations passed a live run on HMC V10R3 M1060 managing a POWER9 system, and the
verification ledger reads `current` for each at the release commit:

- `system.get`
- `lpar.get`, `lpar.get_state`, `lpar.summary`
- `lpar.power_on`, `lpar.power_off`
- `lpar.capture_console`, `lpar.list_refcodes`
- `lpar.create`, `lpar.delete`
- `job.get`, `job.wait`
- `pcie.list_dedicated_slots`, `pcie.assign_dedicated_slot`, `pcie.unassign_dedicated_slot`

The claim covers the MCP tools the run called and what it asserted. It does not cover the
`hmcpctl` CLI commands that wrap the same operations, and power-off, for example, was verified
for delayed and immediate shutdown only.
[What 0.1.0 supports](https://github.com/randomparity/hmcpctl/blob/v0.1.0/docs/compatibility.md#what-010-supports) maps each operation to its
tool. `just verification-report` prints every operation's current state, and
[`docs/capabilities/`](https://github.com/randomparity/hmcpctl/blob/v0.1.0/docs/capabilities/README.md) holds the ledger, which is authoritative.

### Known issues

- Most of the catalog is not live-verified at this commit. Of 163 operations, 17 read
  `current`, 90 `stale`, 39 `unevidenced` and 17 `unrecorded`. The two `current` operations
  outside the list above are not claimed. The ledger is authoritative for each operation.
- The logical LPAR workflow tools (`hmc_inventory`, `hmc_plan_lpar`, `hmc_power_lpar`,
  `hmc_inspect_lpar`, `hmc_operation_status`, `hmc_search_tools`, `hmc_invoke_tool`) ship
  without verification. Their workflow is the 0.2.0 target (#1215).
- HMC V11 and POWER11 are not verified for this release. Some SR-IOV inventory reads are
  admitted on captured V11R2 systems (ADR 0183), but no claimed operation was exercised there.
- `hmc_provision_lpar` with a dedicated PCIe slot fails live. The slot is written into the new
  partition's profile, but provisioning powers on the current configuration, so the running
  partition does not own the slot. How provisioning should activate is undecided (#1390).
- Network boot is not supported by the LPAR power-on operation (#868).
- `hmc_read_lpar_refcodes`' description says an unknown partition is believed to return an
  empty list. It raises an error instead, as #893 established.
- A name lookup without a managed-system selector uses the HMC-wide search, which may stall,
  or report a partition as not found, while a managed system is in `No Connection` (#1309).
  Passing the system selector avoids it for reads. `hmc_create_lpar`'s and
  `hmc_provision_lpar`'s duplicate-name check and read-back search HMC-wide regardless. Reads
  of a system in `Recovery` or `No Connection` are otherwise uncaptured (#1290).
- A failed storage-mapping create can leave an unmapped VIOS server adapter that
  `storage list-mappings` does not show. Compare the VIOS's virtual SCSI server adapters with
  its mappings after such a failure (#1250).
- The shared memory pool tools assume `lshwres -r mempool` field names and a remove form that
  no capture has confirmed (#1245).
- Setting `remote_user_id` on an HMC user writes facets that no capture has confirmed, so the
  HMC may refuse the request (#1414).
- Builds report the static version `0.1.0` regardless of commit; git-derived dev versions are
  planned (#1471).
