def isolate_audit_logging():
    """Give every test a pristine ``hmcpctl.audit`` logger, and restore it after.

    ``audit_sink.install_audit_sink`` mutates process-global state: it sets
    ``propagate = False`` unconditionally, attaches a handler, and sets a level.
    Several tests call it directly, and ``server._serve_application`` calls it too
    — which ``tests/app/test_capability_ceiling.py`` and
    ``tests/app/test_connection_authorization.py`` drive in-process. Whichever runs
    first would otherwise leave the sink installed for the rest of the session, and
    a later ``caplog`` assertion would capture nothing and pass vacuously.

    So it resets at setup as well as restoring at teardown: restoring alone would
    faithfully restore an earlier test's contamination, which is the failure this
    exists to prevent. Autouse and in ``conftest.py`` rather than opted into
    per-file, because the files that merely *emit* a record — every test driving an
    ADR 0011 ownership override — are as able to leak state as the ones that read
    records, and any enumeration of them goes stale.

    It also snapshots and restores ``logging.root.handlers``, which it never
    modifies itself. That is a deliberate belt-and-braces sweep, not dead code:
    several audit tests clear or add root handlers to observe
    ``logging.lastResort``, which ``callHandlers`` consults only after an ancestor
    walk finds none. Each of those cleans up after itself; this is the backstop for
    one that forgets, since a stray root handler silently changes what every later
    test captures.

    Since ADR 0051 it does the same for the ``fastmcp`` logger, whose handlers
    ``_serve_application`` also replaces; since #330's amendment it does it for the
    three further loggers that install binds — ``uvicorn``, ``uvicorn.access`` and
    ``mcp`` — which add level and propagation to what must be restored. Those
    loggers need their pristine state captured at import rather than reset to empty,
    so the snapshots live at module level and this fixture only applies them — at
    setup as well as teardown, for the reason above.

    Since #534 the ``hmcpctl`` logger is reset the same way, for the same reason:
    ``server.install_package_stderr_sink`` attaches a handler to it, and a handler
    left behind by a serving test would take a later test's ``hmcpctl.*`` records
    onto the sink and out of whatever that test meant to read them from.
