"""The audit record's rendering, its bounds, and its sink.

Covers docs/workflow/specs/2026-08-19-authorization-audit-events-design.md and
docs/workflow/specs/2026-08-19-non-blocking-stderr-diagnostics-design.md; the
decision records are docs/adr/0040-authorization-audit-events.md and
docs/adr/0043-non-blocking-stderr-diagnostics.md.

Logging isolation comes from the autouse ``isolate_audit_logging`` fixture in
``tests/conftest.py``. Nothing here may install a sink without it.

Spec test -> node id. This map is checked by
``test_every_spec_numbered_test_named_in_the_header_still_exists`` — keep it true.
