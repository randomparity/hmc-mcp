"""Tests for client_parse's error-tagging wrappers.

The two helpers under test exist specifically so a ParseError surfaces as an
HMCError naming the HMC call that returned the malformed XML (the same
behavior covered end-to-end in tests/unit/test_client.py for the feed and PCM
preferences paths); these unit tests pin the tagging contract directly.
