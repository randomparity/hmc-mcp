"""Fleet-wide and system reads take their systems from ``ManagedSystem/quick/All`` (#1501).

The 2026-10-13 capture (#1290) saw the full ``ManagedSystem`` feed, and a
``No Connection`` system's ``ManagedSystem/{uuid}`` entry, time out.
``quick/All`` answered; its captured ``rest-ms-quick-all-no-connection-v11r2``
record lists eleven systems, two of them (``sys-R8``, ``sys-R11``) in
``no connection``. Here the full feed, the name search and a disconnected
system's entry raise read timeouts, and a disconnected system's scoped feeds
answer 204 as captured in #1289.
