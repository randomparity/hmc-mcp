# reached from a declared selector, or not? `file_path` fails it because
# `bkprofdata -f` and `rstprofdata -f` take an absolute console path the declared
# `-m` system does not constrain — which is why the tool that only *reads* that
# path is unbounded too, and why "the file is written" is not the rule.
# `backup_name` on `hmc_restore_vios` passes it, and ADR 0044 records why; the

# by admitting only `http` and `https`, so the name is now a remote URL like the
# rest of this set and belongs here for the same reason they do. It stays named
# in this comment rather than quietly folded in, because the classification was
# once a judgement call and the record of why should not evaporate with the
# branch that made it one.
#

    Live-HMC evidence for #282 established that an SSP restore is cluster-scoped,

    0044 independently keeps ``backup_name`` bounded because it is a catalog name,
    and its validation remains required after the tool becomes non-exhaustive.

    `asyncssh.connect` is patched to raise rather than mocked to succeed: if the

    makes that a loud failure here instead of a socket attempt from the suite.
