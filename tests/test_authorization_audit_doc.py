"""The audit documents must agree with the vocabularies they mirror.

#486. `audit.REASONS`, `audit.EVENTS`, `audit.State`, `tool_registry.EFFECTS` and
`client.VERIFY_SSL_SOURCES` are closed vocabularies, each derived from a `Literal` so
"a checker and a test can consult" it. `docs/authorization-audit.md` restates all five —
as a reason-code table, as one `### event:` section apiece, as the `effect` row of the
authorization field table, as the sentence enumerating the `connection.state` arms, and
as the clause naming the TLS record's `source` values — and nothing read it, so the two
sides could drift apart silently. They had.

`audit.DECISIONS` is the sixth, restated as the `decision` row of the same field table
and as the reason-code table's middle column (#518). It was the one vocabulary with no
alias to derive from — its `Literal` was written inline in `record_authorization`'s own
signature — so it has been lifted to `audit.Decision` beside its siblings rather than
read back off the signature here. Both `Literal`-annotated parameters of that builder are
now held to the frozenset derived from their alias, so re-inlining either one reddens
instead of leaving every check below comparing against a vocabulary the builder has
stopped accepting.

`docs/environment-variables.md`'s `HMC_VERIFY_SSL` note describes the same TLS record, so
its restatement of the `source` values is held to the same set and neither document can
drift alone (#497). Two further restatements were in code — `audit`'s record builder and
its test — and are gone: each names `client.VerifySSLSource` instead, so the last check
below holds a pointer rather than comparing a vocabulary, there being none left in them
to compare (#504). Its residuals are in the ledger.

Every equality check below is a set comparison, so it fails on an orphan (documented,
not defined) and on a dangling entry (defined, not documented) alike — with one bounded
exception in the ledger, for a member appended to a run-based list with "and". Each is
paired with a mutation test that feeds the extractor a deliberately drifted copy of the
real document and asserts it notices, so the check cannot pass by extracting nothing.

The audit document's sample records are read by parsing the fenced JSON rather than by
backticking the literals inside them, which would stop them being JSON at all: a sample is
the one place a consumer copies a log query or an alert rule from, so it has to stay valid
and copy-pasteable (#506). Parsing reads them structurally, which is also what separates
the TLS record's top-level `source` from the `attribution.source` beside it — the same key
naming a different vocabulary. Only `event` is held in both directions there, because one
section and at least one sample apiece makes coverage checkable; one sample record shows
one `reason`, one `effect`, one `state`, one `kind` and one `decision`, so those are held
to naming nothing undefined. For `reason`, `effect`, `state` and `decision` the other half
is kept by the reason-code table, the `effect` and `decision` rows and the state sentence,
which are checked above; `kind` restates no such passage, so it is held in the orphan
direction alone and the ledger records it.
Coverage reads `event` at the top level and the orphan half reads it at any depth, so a
nested value cannot stand in for a missing record. Coverage is checked twice: over the
document, and over the `## The records` section alone, so an event sampled in two places
cannot lose the copy under its own heading. The price is an editing constraint: every
`json` fence in that document must open one of these records, written at the start of its
line. A fence that opens something else fails quoting the block and stating the rule; one
the reader cannot take fails naming every opener it found, by line.
`docs/environment-variables.md` carries no JSON block and so has no arm of this check.

The counts stay out of the assertions on purpose: pinning one here would recreate the
stale literal this guard exists to remove, the same anti-pattern
`test_project_metadata.test_generated_policy_guidance_does_not_pin_a_stale_tool_count`
already guards in the README. Two patterns hold the document to the same rule — one for
counts of reason codes, one for counts of records or events, which is the class that had
actually gone stale ("The two records", written when there were two).

Restated *constants* are checked where the constant is exported and nothing else.

What this does not reach, so a green run is not read as more coverage than it is:

- an enumeration written out in prose rather than as a table or a heading, unless it is
  one of the two `source` clauses below — the guard compares vocabularies, so a sentence
  listing the members by name goes stale silently. The documents avoid them where they
  can and state the rule instead;
- a pinned count of the `source` vocabulary, in either document. The count patterns below
  anchor on a noun, and "source" is ordinary English this document already uses for
  something else — "the two sources" of an ownership-override record names two code paths,
  not two `source` values — so an alternation for it would fail on prose that is correct.
  Both documents are held to the membership of that vocabulary and not to its size;
- a pinned count anywhere in `docs/environment-variables.md`. The count patterns run over
  the audit document, whose subject is these vocabularies; turning them loose on a
  document about twenty settings would read its ordinary prose ("one SSH login plus two
  REST GETs") the same wrong way. Only the `HMC_VERIFY_SSL` note's membership is guarded;
- a member appended to a run-based list with "and" rather than a comma or "or".
  `FIELD_VALUE_LIST` and `SOURCE_LIST` end the run at the first separator they do not
  recognise, which is what lets the negative controls treat a trailing clarification as
  prose — and the same tradeoff means `..., or `field-default`, and `config-file`` reads as
  three values plus prose. The dangling direction is unaffected; only the orphan half has
  the hole, and only for those two extractors;
- the dangling direction for the reason-code table's middle column. Every cell there is
  held to naming a defined decision, and the `decision` field row above holds the other
  half — but nothing requires each decision to appear in that column, because which reason
  code yields which decision is a claim this document makes rather than one the code
  derives: `reason` and `decision` are independent parameters of the record builder. A
  decision arm that no reason code yields would be documented in the row and absent from
  the table, and that is not drift. What the column does carry is an editing constraint,
  and it fails loud: `REASON_ROW` reads both cells at once, so a decision cell widened
  into prose takes its whole row out of the reason vocabulary and reddens the equality
  check, rather than quietly ceasing to be read;
- the sample records' `policy`, `tool` and `targets[].argument` values, none of which is a
  closed vocabulary. `policy` is an example name; `tool` names a registry entry rather
  than a `Literal`, and deriving that set means importing the server, which this module
  does not do; and `argument` is a plain `str` on `TargetSelector`, drawn from
  `REQUIRED_TARGET_ARGUMENTS`'s keys *and* from whatever a tool's own `extra_targets`
  declares, so that mapping is a subset of the field's range rather than its vocabulary and
  is not read here at all. `kind` is the closed half of that pair, held to `TARGET_KINDS`;
- whether the sample keys held are *all* of them. `SAMPLE_VOCABULARIES` lists six, and
  `source` is a seventh held by hand below — that is the set as of this commit, and nothing
  enforces that an eighth gets added: a new closed vocabulary on a record, or a `Literal`
  swapped in for one of the plain `str` fields above, joins the samples unread. Enforcing
  it means scanning `audit`, `client` and `tool_registry` for `Literal`s and holding the
  leftovers against a named exclusion list, which is a second unenforced list in place of
  this sentence;
- a record written outside a `json` fence — fenced as ```text, or in prose. The fence rule
  reaches what claims to be JSON; nothing makes a record claim it. One fence carries one
  object, which is every sample the document has, so a fence holding several records on
  several lines would fail as malformed rather than being read line by line;
- the dangling direction for the samples' `kind`. The document restates no `kind`
  vocabulary anywhere, so it has no second passage of the kind that lets `effect`,
  `decision` and the connection states be checked for coverage. Add an arm to
  `TARGET_KINDS` and the samples stay silently right, showing one of however many there
  now are;
- the sample's `attribution.source` value on the `ownership-override` record,
  `config:agent_id`, which restates no exported constant. Its counterpart on the
  `authorization` record is held to `audit.ATTRIBUTION_ENV` in the sample itself, because
  the constant check below is satisfied by the prose under the record and would stay green
  while the sample drifted;
- a `source` written anywhere in a sample but the top level of the TLS record. The
  extractor is scoped there because `attribution.source` under the same key names where an
  identity claim came from instead, and holding it to the TLS vocabulary would redden on a
  document that is right. A future event carrying a top-level `source` from some third
  vocabulary would go unread for the same reason;
- the sample records' editing constraint, which unlike the TLS passage's carries no editor
  marker in the document. It needs none in the same way: the failure names the offending
  block and quotes it, so an editor who adds a non-record `json` fence is told what is
  wrong rather than pointed at a regex whose name means nothing to them;
- the editing constraint this guard puts on the two documents. Both TLS passages must keep
  the `SOURCE_CLAUSE` wording in order, with or without `effective` — the
  environment-variable note writes no `source` identifier to anchor on, so ordinary prose
  is the only anchor available — and that note must stay one `- **` bullet. The regex is
  the authority; this bullet pins no count, for the reason the paragraph above gives. Line
  breaks within the clause do not matter, because `_tls_passage` collapses whitespace, so
  re-wrapping either paragraph is safe. Every violation fails loud, but it fails naming a
  regex, and an editor of a settings document has no reason to open a test named for a
  different one. Both documents now carry an editor marker saying so —
  `docs/authorization-audit.md`'s since #497, the settings document's since #504 — and
  each marker's quoted phrase is derived from `SOURCE_CLAUSE`, so it cannot be deleted,
  moved away from its passage, or left behind by a rewording without reddening a check.
  The marker is a pointer, not a guard: it tells an editor where the rule lives;
- the module half of the two code pointers. `_alias_name` finds the alias wherever in
  `client` it is bound, so a rename reddens — but both docstrings write the dotted path
  `hmc_mcp.client.VerifySSLSource` in prose, and moving the alias to another module would
  leave that prefix wrong behind a green run;
- a third pointer, the `:data:` reference in `client._verify_ssl_source`'s own docstring,
  which nothing here reads. A rename forces an edit to that function's return annotation
  two lines away, so the rename is not silent — but the docstring is prose beside it and
  can be left behind, exactly as the two above could before #504;
- a *paraphrase* of the vocabulary in either code docstring. The check below compares
  against the members themselves, so "the explicit argument, the environment variable or
  the field default" passes it. What it closes is the restatement that goes stale on a
  rename; a description of the same shape in ordinary words is not reached, for the same
  reason the first bullet gives about the documents.

The environment-variable restatement is kept rather than replaced by a cross-reference,
which would have deleted half this machinery. It is where an operator deciding whether to
leave verification off actually reads, and #497's fourth criterion asked for it to be
covered. Guarding it is the price of leaving it there, and that price is this ledger.

Its check is filed here rather than in `tests/test_env_var_guard.py`, which is the module
an editor of that document already opens. Weighed and chosen: this is one vocabulary with
one extractor, and splitting the two arms across modules would put half a set comparison
in each and leave the ledger describing coverage that lives somewhere else. The
discoverability cost is what that document's editor marker pays down.
